# Polish TODOs

## Visual
- [ ] Fix the "holes" in the pins (rendering issue)

## Audio
- [ ] Add sound effects to make it more punchy
  - UI clicks/interactions
  - Circuit placement sounds
  - Simulation running sounds
  - Success/failure sounds

## Content
- [ ] Fill out more levels
  - NAND/NOR gates
  - XOR
  - Latches/flip-flops
  - Multiplexers
  - Adders
  - etc.

## Flavor/Atmosphere
- [ ] Make all help text more obtuse and challenging (Soviet manual style?)
- [ ] Rework backstory: US decoding captured Soviet chip designs instead of Russians making them
  - Cold War reverse-engineering angle
  - Maybe found in a crashed satellite or captured equipment
  - Player is an American engineer figuring out how these mysterious chips work
